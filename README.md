<h1>Cyber & Dragons</h1>

Since the dawn of the quarantine period, about 352 year ago, lonely roll players turned away from their their Corona-infested mates and started playing online.

The technology was fickle and brittle, so a hero must be build!

This amazing creature must obtain stable video communication, private chats, and the cleanest and clearest UI you have ever seen.

The hero will be born battle ready, with a quick and automatic CI/CD process.

## So, how can you help improve it

1. First of all FORK the project to your own github account
2. Then clone it (do not zip it, for zipping is the path to the dark side). do that:
`git clone https://github.com/[your-user-name]/Cyber-and-Dragons`
<br>If you were presumptuous and cloned from my user instead of forking, fork it, and use this link https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/changing-a-remotes-url to change the git remote url
3. ``yarn install``. if you do not have yarn installed, first install yarn 0_O
4. ``yarn dev`` will run the website on http://localhost:3000/ (and server on http://localhost:3003/)
<br>``yarn storybook`` will run storybook on http://localhost:6006/
<br> Choose Wisely
5. When you want ot offer your empowerment to that masterpiece, commit and push to your repo, and then add a Pull Request
<br> Wait, but what's a PR??? https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
<br> I will review it and give my remarks. When it's ready I will merge it, and it will be automatically deployed to a heroku hosted domain on [add address later]
